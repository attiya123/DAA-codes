# ðŸ“Š DAA Assignments - Time Complexity Analysis

This repository contains my assignments for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. Each assignment focuses on implementing classic algorithms and analyzing their time complexity.

##  Contents

- ðŸ“Œ Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, etc.)
- ðŸ“Œ Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- ðŸ“Œ Recursion-based Problems
- ðŸ“Œ Time Complexity Analysis for each problem

##  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to calculate worst, average, and best-case time complexities  
- Practical implementation of algorithm efficiency  
- Basics of asymptotic notations: O(n), Î©(n), and Î˜(n)  

##  Technologies Used

- Language: `C++`
- IDE: Any (CodeBlocks, VS Code, etc.)


1. Clone this repo  
(https://github.com/attiya123/DAA-codes/edit/main/README.md)

3. Open the files in your preferred C++ IDE
4. Compile and run any `.cpp` file to see the output and time complexity comments
